*** Purpose of this project:
Gain experience working with a library (SDL) that handles video/audio output and
keystroke input.

Gain a better general understanding of computer architecture and how to emulate
the hardware as software.

Another reason for undertaking this project is my interest in video games and
emulators.

*** Compilation
All code compiled using MinGW.
Compilation command used is in the .bat file.
